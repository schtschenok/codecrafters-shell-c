["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) by CodeCrafters.

* Figure out if I should even use str* in string library, maybe just copy these structs everywhere?
* Can builtins table be done a bit better?
* Finally write proper string appending! str_append_str(), str_append_cstr()
